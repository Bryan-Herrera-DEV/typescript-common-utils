## Commit messages format
We prefer that you use the following format for your commits: (`<type>: <issue number> :emoji:`): short description. If you need to provide more information, include it in the detailed commit message.

For emojis, we recommend using the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) list.

Types of commits may include (but are not limited to):
