# Typescript Common Utils

The Useful Types library is an indispensable tool for any developer who works with TypeScript on a regular basis. This library is designed to provide a wide range of common types used in everyday software development.

Often, developers find themselves writing and rewriting the same types in different projects. This library aims to solve this problem by providing a complete set of well-defined and extensively tested types.

The library of useful types consists of a number of type definitions ranging from the most basic to the most advanced. These include:

- Basic types such as strings, numbers, and Booleans.
- Complex types such as promises, functions and classes.
- Utility types such as ClassConstructor, which allows the creation of instances of a given class.
- Custom types that are common in many projects, such as user objects, settings, events, etc.
